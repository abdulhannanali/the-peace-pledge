   No body wants war and distrust in this world. This world is a beautiful place with so many awesome people but some distrust and impatience can change this beautiful place with beautiful people and cats into anarchy and chaos. Let's establish peace between borders and solve the problems in a peaceful way and let's embrace the others with open arms as they are just humans like us and humans can get buggy sometimes too. There will be tough times but it'll be #[b boldness] of the peace pledgers that will find a way. There's always a different solution to a problem. We just have to think it the other way and this pledge invites you to think it like #[b  awesome humans]. Sign this pledge and be part of the effort to bring change. Humans are creator of all the major global and political issues and humans only have the power to solve'em. Let's keep aside the irrationalities which benefit a few and kills #[span  (class="red-text") millions] and be rational about stuff. Sign this pledge and be the change you want to see in the world. #[b HIGH FIVE]
